'''
The span si of a stockâ€™s price on a certain day i is the minimum
number of consecutive days (up to the current day) the price of the
stock has been less than its price on that ith day. If for a
particular day, if no stock price is greater then just count the
number of days till 0th day including current day. For eg. if given
price array is {3, 6, 8, 1, 2}, span for 4th day (which has price 2)
is 2 because minimum count of consecutive days (including 4th day
itself) from current day which has price less than 4th day is 2 (i.e.
day 3 & 4). Similarly, span for 2nd day is 3 because no stock price in
left is greater than 2nd day's price. So count is 3 till 0th day.
Given an input array with all stock prices, you need to return the
array with corresponding spans of each day. Note : Try doing it in
O(n).
